# Final Brain Cell 

Game based on a guessing system, where the player has a limited number of attempts to guess a random number. Each incorrect attempt 'eliminates' a brain cell, and the player loses when all brain cells are depleted.

### Explanation:

. The player has 5 attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 10.

. Each time the player guesses incorrectly, they lose a 'brain cell' (an attempt). 

. If the player guesses correctly before losing all brain cells, they win. 

. If the player cannot guess the correct number within 5 attempts, the game ends, 
and the correct number is revealed.

### To compile the C++ code:

`g++ the-final-brain-cell.cpp -o the-final-brain-cell`

### To run the compiled program:

`./the-final-brain-cell
